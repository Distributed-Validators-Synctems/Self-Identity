**Distributed Validators Synctems** is the first **Decentralized Autonomous Synchronization** of validators.

Yes, you read it right way! Not __"Systems"__, and not __"Organization"__.

We are living in a paradigm shift. <br />
The words *"System"* and *"Organization"* are words from the old industrial paradigm, where everything had a center and a creator. A new paradigm requires new words, and therefore it is up to us to create them!

The word **"Synctem"** comes from the word **"Synchronization"**. <br />
This is a system that didn't appear by anyone's will, but which is self-created in the process of synchronization.

The word *"Organization"* is also not acceptable for our self-identity, since "organization" means the organizer (*center*). <br />
Therefore, we use the word **"Synchronization"** not only as a verb, but also as a noun - *different parts that have become one as a result of synchronization*.

At the moment, [DVS Validators](https://github.com/Distributed-Validators-Synctems/Self-Identity/blob/main/meet-our-validators.md) are represented in almost 50 networks, in the main-nets and in the test-nets.

If you are a staker (*delegator*), then you can always be sure that with the validators from the **DVS** you will receive not only a reward from the network, but also guarantees of compensation of funds in case of slashing of our validators, as well as *crypto-gifts* and *NFTs* in cases of significant events and achievements of new milestones. <br />
All [DVS-validators](https://github.com/Distributed-Validators-Synctems/self-identity/blob/main/meet-our-validators.md) are public figures, and you can always communicate with them as with your friends and colleagues.

If you are a validator and you are tired of endless competition for a stake, and want to have a real digital-friends - write to us! <br />
We are **open synchronization**, but we care a lot about our reputation. Our **synchronization** can only contain validators that meet modern requirements. <br />
If you are not 100% confident in your skills, then we will gladly help you with consultations, educational materials, as well as accompanying you on the way to professional validation.
