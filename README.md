**Distributed Validators Synctems** is the first **Decentralized Autonomus Synchronization** of validators.

Yes, you read it right way! Not __"Systems"__, and not __"Organization"__.

We are living in a paradigm shift.
The words __"System"__ and __"Organization"__ are words from the old industrial paradigm, where everything had a center and a creator. A new paradigm requires new words, and therefore it is up to us to create them!

The word **"Synctem"** comes from the word **"Synchronization"**. 
This is a system that didn't appear by anyone's will, but which self-created as a result of synchronization.

The word __"Organization"__ is also not acceptable for our self-identity, since "organization" means the organizer (center). Therefore, we use the word **"Synchronization"** not only as a verb, but also as a noun - a union that arose in the process of synchronization.

At the moment, **DVS** synchronizes five validators, that are validating almost 50 networks, in the main-nets and in the test-nets.

If you are a staker (delegator), then you can always be sure that with the validators from the **DVS** you will receive not only a reward from the network, but also guarantees of compensation of funds in case of slashing of our validators, as well as crypto-gifts and NTF s in cases of significant events and achievements of new milestones.
All __DVS-validators__ are public figures, and you can always communicate with them as with your friends and colleagues.

If you are a validator and you are tired of endless competition for a stake, and want to have a real digital-friends - write to us!
We are open synchronization, but we care a lot about our reputation. Our synchronization can only contain validators that meet modern requirements.
If you are not 100% confident in your skills, then we will gladly help you with consultations, educational materials, as well as accompanying you on the way to professional validation.
